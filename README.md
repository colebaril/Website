# Welcome to my Website Repository

This is the first website I made and am treating it as a combination of a CV, place to store my Master's thesis online, and a blog for my personal hobbies. This website serves as a place for me to use R and document my R programming journey in a fun and personal way. I chose am using the `blogdowm` R package and `Hugo` to build my site and I am using the theme [LoveIt](www.github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt). The site deploys on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) from [Github](www.github.com/colebaril/website).
