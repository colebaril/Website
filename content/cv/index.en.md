> I completed my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of Winnipeg where I first became interested in vector-borne pathogens.
> I recently completed my Master of Science at Brandon University where I studied and led projects relating to mosquito borne pathogen 
> surveillance.
> My team and I conducted twice-weekly mosquito surveillance in Western Manitoba from June to August in 2020 and 2021 and caught ~300,000 
> mosquitoes. We conducted shotgun metatranscriptomic sequencing to identify pathogens harboured by mosquitoes, screened mosquitoes for the 
> presence of California serogroup viruses and conducted generalized linear mixed modelling to identify relationships between mosquito activity 
> and weather variables.
