title: About Cole
---



> I completed my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of Winnipeg where I first became interested in vector-borne pathogens.
> I recently completed my Master of Science at Brandon University where I studied and led projects relating to mosquito borne pathogen 
> surveillance.
> My team and I conducted twice-weekly mosquito surveillance in Western Manitoba from June to August in 2020 and 2021 and caught ~300,000 
> mosquitoes. We conducted shotgun metatranscriptomic sequencing to identify pathogens harboured by mosquitoes, screened mosquitoes for the 
> presence of California serogroup viruses and conducted generalized linear mixed modelling to identify relationships between mosquito activity 
> and weather variables. 

> My other interests include baking, hiking and reading. I look for every excuse I can to bake. I specialize in cakes, cookies and crumbles. 
> I regularly go hiking around Manitoba where my favourite place to hike is in Riding Mountain National Park. I also enjoy reading fantasy 
> book series such as *Harry Potter*, *Lord of the Rings* and the *Inheritance Cycle*. 

> This website will be a place where I document my research experience, hobby activities and write about topics that interest me.
