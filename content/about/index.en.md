## Education and Training

 I completed my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of Winnipeg where I first became interested in vector-borne pathogens.
 I recently completed my Master of Science at Brandon University where I studied and led projects relating to mosquito borne pathogen 
 surveillance.
 
 My team and I conducted twice-weekly mosquito surveillance in Western Manitoba from June to August in 2020 and 2021 and caught ~300,000 
 mosquitoes. We conducted shotgun metatranscriptomic sequencing to identify pathogens harboured by mosquitoes, screened mosquitoes for the 
 presence of California serogroup viruses and conducted generalized linear mixed modelling to identify relationships between mosquito activity
 and weather variables. 
 
 After my M.Sc., I have been lucky to get a job with the Public Health Agency of Canada. I am involved with international and domestic public health projects that have a wide-reaching positive impact on global health.

## Hobbies

 My other interests include baking, hiking and reading. I look for every excuse I can to bake. I specialize in cakes, cookies and crumbles. 
 I regularly go hiking around Manitoba where my favourite place to hike is in Riding Mountain National Park. I also enjoy reading fantasy 
 book series such as *Harry Potter*, *Lord of the Rings* and the *Inheritance Cycle*. I have also taken up coding as a hobby and this site will serve as a medium
 to showcase those projects.

 This website will be a place where I document my research experience, hobby activities and write about topics that interest me. Additionally, it will serve as a medium for keeping my R and programming skills up-to-date.
