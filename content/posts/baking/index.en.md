## Bread

Bread making can be a time consuming, tedious and tiresome process. However, using the dutch oven method makes making delicious bread fast and easy.

### Whole Wheat Bread 

The whole wheat variant is very similar to but slightly different than the white version. Notably I add ground flaxmeal for extra flavour and cooking time is slightly less uncovered.
