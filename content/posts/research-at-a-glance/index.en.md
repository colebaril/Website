## 1 Research Summary

Mosquito borne diseases cause over 700,000 human deaths each year around the globe, cause considerable morbidity and costs many millions of dollars to treat and prevent. The burden of mosquito borne disease in the Canadian Prairies, where climate change is expected to be felt the most in Canada, is likely to increase as temperatures warm, precipitation patterns change, and more severe weather events occur. To better understand the public health risks posed to Manitobans as the climate changes, we investigated the relationship between weather variables and mosquitoes in addition to identifying pathogens being harboured by mosquitoes in Manitoba. My thesis was divided into two sections: mosquito borne pathogen surveillance using PCR and next generation sequencing (NGS) applications and mosquito weather-based modelling. The first study involved two consecutive years of collecting mosquito abundance and time-series data and using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to test for relationships between mosquito abundance and growing degree days, precipitation, and relative humidity. We found quadratic and linear relationships between mosquito abundance and relative humidity for all species and growing degree days and precipitation for some species. Overall, this study furthers our understanding of mosquito population dynamics and vector potential in Manitoba.  The second study utilized metatranscriptomic NGS to identify pathogens harboured by mosquitoes in Manitoba. We also used PCR to screen regionally and temporally pooled mosquito samples for the presence of California serogroup viruses. Sequences belonging to 33 viral genomes and an array of protozoan, fungal and bacterial  sequences were detected, of which seven viruses were found to be novel. Two positive mosquito pools were identified for CSGVs, one in each year of surveillance.  

## 2 Mosquito Activity and Weather

Mosquito borne diseases account for over 700,000 deaths globally each year, yet little is known about factors that drive mosquito vectors, particularly those of the re-emerging California serogroup viruses, in Manitoba. We conducted a two-year intensive surveillance program to identify the activity of vector species in Manitoba. Further, we utilized generalized linear mixed models to determine the relationships between mosquito vectors and time, degree days, precipitation, and relative humidity. Approximately 270,000 mosquitoes were trapped over the two-year surveillance period. *Aedes vexans*, *Coquillettidia perturbans*, *Ochlerotatus dorsalis* and *Culex tarsalis* were predominant while *Ochlerotatus flavescens*, *Ochlerotatus triseriatus*, *Ochlerotatus trivittatus*, *Aedes canadensis*, and *Anopheles earlei* were present in low numbers. Positive relationships were identified between *Ae. vexans* and degree days, precipitation. and relative humidity. Relationships were also identified between *Cq. perturbans* and relative humidity. Furthermore, positive relationships were also identified between *Oc. dorsalis* and degree days and relative humidity as well as *Cx. tarsalis* and degree days and relative humidity. This chapter will contribute to our knowledge of mosquito species abundance, population dynamics, and describe weather factors that drive mosquito abundance in Manitoba. 

## 3 California Serogroup Virus Screening

Mosquito borne diseases account for over 700,000 deaths around the globe each year, yet little is known currently about the presence of California serogroup viruses (CSGVs), a group of re-emerging mosquito borne viruses in Manitoba. Human and mosquito samples tested positive in Manitoba in the 1980s, but no recent mosquito surveillance for CSGVs has been carried out recently despite there being human cases and CSGVs occuring in mosquito populations in adjacent regions (e.g., North Dakota). Currently, there is no established surveillance program for CSGVs and human testing only occurs for patients who test negative for West Nile Virus (WNV). For these reasons it is likely that the burden of CSGVs on Manitobans is underestimated. We screened ~30,000 mosquitoes for the presence of CSGVs via PCR in 2020 and 2021. Two pools were found to be positive for a CSGV: one in Brandon from *Aedes vexans* mosquitoes in 2020 and another in *Aedes vexans* mosquitoes caught in Shoal Lake, Manitoba in 2021, which was identified as *Cache Valley Virus* by Sanger Sequencing.

## 4 Shotgun Metatranscriptomic Sequencing of Mosquitoes 

Mosquito borne diseases account for over 700,000 deaths around the globe each year, yet little is known about what microbes are harboured by mosquitoes in Manitoba aside from West Nile Virus. We conducted a two-year intensive surveillance program to identify what pathogens are being harboured by mosquitoes in Manitoba using metatranscriptomics. From 45 mosquito samples representing >30,000 mosquitoes, we identified a total of 33 viruses of which some are of potential public health concern (e.g., Chuvirus), some are of economic/environmental concern (e.g., Black Queen Cell Virus) and others are newly reported in North America (e.g., Mekrijarvi Negevirus). Furthermore, seven of these viruses were found to be putatively novel viruses being harboured by mosquitoes in Manitoba. We also identified through metatranscriptomic sequencing a variety of protozoans, fungi, bacteria being harboured by mosquitoes, as well as blood and nectar meal sources.  This study provides insight into the suite of microbes being harboured by mosquitoes in Manitoba.
