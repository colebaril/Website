## 1 Introduction



## 2 Methods

### 2.1 Mosquito Trapping

Mosquitoes were trapped using [CDC Miniature Light Traps](https://www.johnwhock.com/products/mosquito-sandfly-traps/new-standard-miniature-incandescent-light-trap/) with carbon dioxide (Model 1012, John W. Hock, Gainesville, FL). Carbon dioxide regulators were set to 15 psi. Traps were set approximately 5-6 feet off the ground hanging off a tree branch on the periphery of townsites and human dwellings. Traps were configured to turn on at dusk and stay on until dawn at which point the fan remains on to retain the catch. The light on the trap was disabled to reduce the number of non-mosquito insects trapped. Traps were operated twice weekly on Monday and Tuesday nights in 2020 and 2021 from June to August (week 23 to 36) in eight communities in Western Manitoba. In 2020, two traps were setup in each location except in Brandon where ten traps were deployed. In 2021, one trap was set up at each location. In total, there were 24 traps deployed twice weekly in 8 locations (2020) and 8 traps in 8 locations (2021). Traps were collected in the morning and live mosquitoes were transported to Brandon University where they were knocked down in a -20°C freezer and emptied into petri plates. Mosquitoes were immediately put into a -80°C freezer until identification.

To augment the analysis, mosquito specimens from 9 other locations throughout the province were collected via one-time satellite traps (CDC Light Traps) and provided to us by the City of Winnipeg Insect Control Branch. For samples provided by the Winnipeg Insect Control Branch, *Culex* mosquitoes were removed prior to receiving them.

### 2.2 Mosquito Identification

Five mosquito species were visually identified by researchers at Brandon University using dissecting microscopes in 2020 and nine mosquito species were visually identified in 2021. The five species were chosen because they were present in traps and known to transmit pathogens such as WNV and California Serogroup Viruses (CSGVs). The number of species under surveillance in 2021 increased because we decided to expand the scope of the study to investigate what microbes are harbored by additional species. Some mosquito specimens representing two mosquito species caught in Brandon in 2019 from June to August by Carlyn et al., 2019 (unpublished work) were also obtained. Specimens were identified using relevant mosquito identification keys (Carpenter and LaCasse, 1955; Thielman and Hunter, 2007; Wood et al., 1979). Mosquitoes were kept on dry ice during identification. Mosquito species identified included *Ochlerotatus dorsalis* Meigen, *Aedes vexans* Meigen, *Ochlerotatus flavescens* Muller, *Culex tarsalis* Coquillett, and *Coquillettidia perturbans* Walker in 2020 with the addition of *Aedes canadensis* Theobald, *Ochlerotatus trivittatus* Coquillett, *Ochlerotatus triseriatus* Say, and *Anopheles earlei* Vargus in 2021. Mosquitoes were sorted by species, location, and trapping date. A maximum of fifty mosquitoes of the same species and from the same location and date were pooled together per sample and stored at -80°C prior to RNA isolation. For traps with a high number of specimens, sub-samples of the trap were counted. Sub-sampling occurred when the trap contained approximately \>1,000 specimens. Total trap counts for sub-sampled traps were extrapolated by multiplying counts (e.g., counted 25% of the trap and multiplied by 4).

### 2.3 RNA Isolation

Total RNA was extracted from the mosquito pools using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturers protocol. We augmented the protocol with a Proteinase K incubation step to aid in tissue breakdown by diluting homogenized sample with 600 µl nuclease-free water and adding 25 µl of Proteinase K. In some cases, the presence of a brown precipitate was observed in RNA extraction products as described by Stapleton et al. (2016). To remove the precipitate, the Qiagen RNA PowerClean Pro Kit (Hilden, Germany) was used for all pooled samples intended for NGS to remove the precipitate and improve RNA quality. RNA quality checks were conducted using a NP80 Implen Nanophotometer.
